## Hi there 👋

I am a graduate of the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, currently in search of my first full-time Software Engineering position. Check out my 📄 resume [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Azef6yaFvN7Ey-pRwN2oUjBuW4MR3_8H/view?usp=sharing)

I originally studied choral music education at The University of Utah and taught high school choir 🎶 for a couple years. While I found a lot of success in the classroom and loved my students, music, and teaching in general, I was 😐 staring down 30 years of doing the same thing day in and day out, and I knew that wasn't going to work for me. I decided to start exploring other career options. After lots of contemplation and 🔬 research, I chose to pursue a career in web development/tech for the following reasons.

It is a career that...
1. 🌱 Not only encourages continuous learning, but requires it.
2. 👯 Revolves around collaboration.
3. 🤔 Challenges me intellectually.
